<PRE>Hi Ray,

&gt;&gt;<i> After editing and saving files for a while the editor forgets that the file has been modified
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and refuses to save any of the open edited files. The project has to be shut down and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reopened to continue and all edits are lost.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've used snavagator for about 10 years, 5 days a week on various linux kde distros and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this bug has always existed but it seems to have gotten worse.
</I>
Yes, unfortunately this bug isn't unknown to me, too, so consider it
officially acknowledged ;)
However, I was under the impression that with the migration to db4 it
has gotten better?

So, 2 questions:
1) are you using the binary builds?
2) if not, how (compiler, configure options, ...) and with what CFLAGS
do you compile your version?

It's definately a thing I'd like to get fixed, but as Mark says,
there's no clue and no immediate solution, because tracking it down
wasn't successful in the past.
Do you want and can you help us out on this one?

Cheers,
F

</PRE>
