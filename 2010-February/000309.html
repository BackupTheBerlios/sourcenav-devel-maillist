<PRE>I'm currently running Source-Navigator NG4.1 installed in /opt on Kubuntu  9.07.

After editing and saving files for a while the editor forgets that the file has been modified 
and refuses to save any of the open edited files. The project has to be shut down and 
reopened to continue and all edits are lost.

I've used snavagator for about 10 years, 5 days a week on various linux kde distros and 
this bug has always existed but it seems to have gotten worse.

Any thoughts?
