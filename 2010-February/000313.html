<PRE>I build it as recommended in INSTALL
./configure --prefix=/opt/sourcenav

Being a c, c++ embedded programmer I haven't learned the tcl syntax or made the time to 
debug it myself. Is there a debug mode I can build to produce a lot of spewage?

Thanks,
Ray

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; After editing and saving files for a while the editor forgets that the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, unfortunately this bug isn't unknown to me, too, so consider it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; officially acknowledged ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, I was under the impression that with the migration to db4 it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has gotten better?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, 2 questions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) are you using the binary builds?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) if not, how (compiler, configure options, ...) and with what CFLAGS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do you compile your version?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's definately a thing I'd like to get fixed, but as Mark says,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there's no clue and no immediate solution, because tracking it down
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wasn't successful in the past.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you want and can you help us out on this one?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; F
