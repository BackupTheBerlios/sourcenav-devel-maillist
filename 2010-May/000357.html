<PRE>Hi all,

&gt;<i> I want to report that snpdbg is not update since &quot;epoc&quot; :D
</I>&gt;<i> In the script are variables never declared like $etcdir that point to
</I>&gt;<i> snpdbg(file) that no longer exists in share/etc directory, now it is in
</I>&gt;<i> share/snavigator/etc. The same stuff for hyper too, that was moved from
</I>&gt;<i> ../bin to ../libexec/snavigtor
</I>
Yes, that's probably true for win32. I've fixed it in my trunk, but
need a win32 box to test on before I commit that. Alternatively you
can also send in your patch.

&gt;<i> I have done all the changes for correct the snpdbg script, as above. Using
</I>&gt;<i> ddd, I want to see cbrowser's functionalities but when i try to attach the
</I>&gt;<i> debugger to the process, ddd kills cbrowser.
</I>&gt;<i>  I would like to know how and when the parsing through the code is done,
</I>&gt;<i> this is the point of using ddd. My &quot;final&quot; task would change the &quot;stop until
</I>&gt;<i> first&quot; behaviour but I don't know how to locate this stuff implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>  I guess, reading at the code, that probably  snavigator/parser/cpp  and
</I>&gt;<i> snavigator/db/dbutils.c make my case but I don't know:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. if they are linked together at compile time
</I>
Yes. dbutils.c is linked into each parser via libdbutils.a

&gt;<i>  2. how to reach with ddd
</I>
Ah, well ... for that I have no real clue right now as they're all fork()ed out.

&gt;<i> 3. why even a printf seems to has no effect (probably because the executable
</I>&gt;<i> run in background?)
</I>
If I remember correctly (in all the parsers) the file descriptor for
stdout (which printf will operate on) has either been closed or
remapped to the pipe &quot;dbimp&quot; is reading from.
So you wont see any output. I also seem to see this problem on win32
with the &quot;normal&quot; hyper process, but I couldn't find out what the
problem was.

Quick workaround: open a file &quot;/tmp/mydebug&quot; and write all your
debugging output there with fprintf().

&gt;<i> I'm going mad...
</I>
Believe me, we all already have when dealing with SN...
Cheers,
F
