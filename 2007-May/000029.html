<PRE>Guys,
Before I get to the request - thanks for the updates to SN.  It's a
great tool and deserves a bright future.  It has proven to be for me,
the best/quickest way to understand application code flow.

This is a quietly voiced request... If anyone has the time and
inclination to followup on it, great.  If not, that's fine too.  I'll
probably continue to hack around with it on occasion and if I ever get
it 'right', will offer it up for inclusion if others deem it worthwhile.

The request:
  Per the application's name, I use SN extensively to navigate through
code.  However, I perform all of my editing in [g]vim.  I would like to
request that someone who has a good understanding of the SN code
implement a right click menu option for editorpane.tcl that would open
the current file in 'an editor of choice' and that would recognize when
the file has been changed and update it in editorpane.tcl.

I note above 'someone who has a good understanding of the SN code'
because I've managed to hack ( and it is a hack ) a right click menu
addition that is hard coded to open the current file in gvim, but I'm
unable to figure out yet how to get the refinements that would be nice
   open in gvim to the current editorpane.tcl selected line
     (once I find the right call to get the currently selected line I
      know that I can pass it to gvim as '+${line_number}')
   recognize and update editorpane.tcl when gvim closes
     ( I'm pretty sure that SN has the capability of recognizing when a
       file has been externally modified -- I've just not found it yet )
   have a 'preferences' pane input box for 'right click external editor'
   etc



Thanks,
reid
