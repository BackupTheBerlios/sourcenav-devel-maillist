<PRE>Dear all,

version NG3 has just been released. You can find it at

<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8334">http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8334</A>

There you will find the source (right now), a win32 i686 binary
package (by next week), and also a Linux i686 binary package (new -
for unpacking to /opt or similar, built on RHEL4/CentOS4).

SVN people can switch to (or checkout) the following URL:

<A HREF="https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/sourcenav/tags/SN-NG3">https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/sourcenav/tags/SN-NG3</A>

This release represents a major step forward (and 5 months of
development since NG2) - we've finally done why I've originally
started the NG project: the migration to db4 library.

The bad news:
----------------
NG3 is no longer compatible to NG2 or the old SN 5.2 regarding its DB
files. You will have to delete all old project files, and completely
re-parse your project with NG3; plus we've changed the database
directory from its hidden default &quot;.snproj&quot; to a non-hidden &quot;SNDB4&quot;.
Also the preferences cannot be loaded by the new version, so it's best
to delete your ~/.sn altogether.
This is due to incompatible changes in the binary format of db4 and
was expected.

The good news:
------------------
db4 performs significantly better when doing lookups for symbols
(definitions, classes, Xref et al). On the other hand db4 has received
a lot of development effort over the years, and has proven to be very
stable.
We've seen spontaneous memory corruptions with the old db-1.85 with
big databases, esp. on win32; bug reports regarding this date back to
the &quot;old&quot; Source Navigator days.

New feature:
--------------
Also, we've added a new feature for the builtin editor context menu -
&quot;Open in external editor&quot;.
That way you can quickly edit the current file in your favourite editor.
If (g)vim or emacs is used, your cursor will also be placed at the
very position it was in the builtin editor.
Please note the new configuration options regarding the external editor.


Contributions were done by and I'd like to express my gratitude
towards (I hope I don't forget anybody):
Mark Thornber (as always, core member)
Reid Thompson (external editor patches)
Daniel Scheibli (64bit related changes, testing)
Aurelian Melinte (db4 migration, testing, building on win32)

As always I'd like to renew my call for core developers.

Cheers and happy xref'ing,
Freek
