<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; plus we've changed the database directory from its hidden default
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;.snproj&quot; to a non-hidden &quot;SNDB4&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Why?  A hidden directory would seem appropriate here.
</I>
I was beginning to strongly dislike it. Why hide SN's inner workings?
If you're having a big project, suddenly 100s of MBs are gone, and you
don't know where.
Or you'll delete the .proj - file by yourself, but you will forget the
.snproj/* stuff.
I talked to Mark, and he didn't reject the idea. He added the 4 (as in
db4) to make even the version more clear. I instantly liked that.

Still, *you* can choose to use another directory, or to revert to the
old one, by simply specifying it in the preferences and saving them as
default!


&gt;<i> &gt; If (g)vim or emacs is used, your cursor will also be placed at the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very position it was in the builtin editor.
</I>&gt;<i> You might want to have a look at my patches for improving Emacs
</I>&gt;<i> support.  They can be found in my Git repository at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.iki.fi/sourcenav-ng.git,">http://www.iki.fi/sourcenav-ng.git,</A> branch emacs.  They are not well
</I>&gt;<i> tested with GNU Emacs though, as I use XEmacs.
</I>
I'd like to, but a quick &quot;git clone&quot; shows:

Cannot get remote repository information.
Perhaps git-update-server-info needs to be run there?

Cheers,
F
