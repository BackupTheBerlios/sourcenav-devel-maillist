<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; That's cool but not at all what I meant.  Check the Version Control tab
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in SourceNav.  You don't have an option for SVN.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I understood what you meant.  I guess my response/request was
</I>&gt;<i> ambiguous in the context that I replied.  +1 for adding SVN to the list
</I>&gt;<i> ala RCS, SCCS, ClearCase.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in addition, if an Other could be added, such that when selected, the
</I>&gt;<i> user can fill in the operational commands for the various revision
</I>&gt;<i> control menu options....
</I>
Ah, this is an area of SN I personally didn't ever use.
If somebody wants to try, they're configured in the sn_prop.cfg
($BASEDIR/share/etc/sn_prop.cfg)

I completely agree that in this day and age we should

1) support SVN natively
2) have a dialogue for the user to configure his own system

I will keep that in mind and try to have it in NG4!

Cheers,
~F
