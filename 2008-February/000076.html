I updated to SVN head yesterday.  Everything is working fine so far.  I
did have to blow away all my old sn project db's and recreate them.  I
assume this was expected.  As info one of the projects that I use SN on
is evolution et al.  ( evolution, evolution-data-server,
evolution-exchange, evolution-webcal, glib, libsoup, gtkhtml,
gnome-icon-theme ). I put all of these under one project in SN and it
parses/manages them fine ( around 3000 .c .h files )


Also for consideration..
what about a generic &quot;Other&quot; source code control, with fields to add in
the commands for:
Check Out
Check In
Discard Changes
Lock
Unlock
Compare Revisions
etc

( possibly even the ability to add to the list of commands offered ).

A lot of my work is on legacy code that is controlled via custom scripts
wrapped around SCCS.  I imagine that this &quot;Other&quot; could also be
configured for darcs, bzr, git, etc etc
