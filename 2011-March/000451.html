</I>I'll reenforce that.

I came across SN when I moved to a new contract and found out just how
expensive SNiFF+ was and how much customisation was needed to get it
to work at all.  At that time (1998) SN was paid-for but the company
that wrote it had just been absorbed by Red Hat and the 'next release'
was going to be free.
