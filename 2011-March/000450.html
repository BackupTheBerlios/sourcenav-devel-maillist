<PRE>Hi Chris,

&gt;<i> Oh and something about building with xft/xft2 helped as well. I guess this
</I>&gt;<i> enabled antialiasing.
</I>
If you have any URLs - can you please post them here? Maybe we can at
least try to understand the solution and how it might apply to us.

&gt;&gt;<i> My distribution has tk/tcl 8.5 I've seen some posts about other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applications having the same issue and building or using the system's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tk/tcl/wish to resolve it.
</I>
Unfortunately we can't readily build against the system's tcl/tk due
to the aforementioned dependencies with itcl etc al.
As for wish: snavigator's tcl code is run by hyper, which is kind of a
wish, but with specific extensions (new tcl commands, db4 library
natively linked in, ...) so you cannot run it with your systems wish.

And I really need to say that we didn't choose that architecture, but
the SN developers did in ancient times ;-)
Cheers,
F
