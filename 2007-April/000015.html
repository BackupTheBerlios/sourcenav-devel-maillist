<PRE>Hi all,

I'd like to get ready for our first release, called NG1.
We still have a 2 MUSTFIX-bugs to work out that manifest heaviyl
(afaik) only in the Windows build. If we don't fix it for NG1, we have
to fix it for NG2 and postpone the first Windows release.

Symbols dialogue:

1) in &quot;Pattern&quot; enter some exact filename, open it, edit it, save it,
close the editor window - suddenly there are *2* entries of this
filename.
This will *NOT* go away, no matter what you do.

I vaguely suspect this being something with case-sensitiveness on the
db-side or being connected to the next issue.

2) I managed to get completely garbled entries in the Symbols dialogue
after multiple edits/saves/project refreshs - looked like heap
corruption me.

This seems to be connected to a rare issue also seen on Linux, where
the DB-process segfaults - but I've got NO clue where to start here or
to at least work around it.

Any volunteers to help a bit out?
Cheers,
F

</PRE>
