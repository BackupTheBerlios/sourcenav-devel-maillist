<PRE>Thanks for the explanation.

Another question, what would it take to convert this to Qt or GTK?  I would
be willing to help in some fashion with this, however, I don't really have
any experience with either.  I just recently bought the Qt 4 book by
Trolltech and had planned on learning Qt.  Is this something that is planned
for a future release?  I was looking through the code (helpfully in SN), but
couldn't really make sense of the layout and the relationship to the GUI
stuff (no TCL/TK experience here either).

&gt;<i> Hi Ryan,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Daniel explained it correctly already. The reason for the real fork
</I>&gt;<i> and that we are on Berlios is that the &quot;old&quot; SN guys were a bit
</I>&gt;<i> hesisant to hand over the project page so I could start the SVN tree
</I>&gt;<i> and get things started.
</I>&gt;<i> The reason behind SN 6.0 (which is EXACTLY SN NG3, only with a changed
</I>&gt;<i> version string) is that we finally got  the SN SourceForge project
</I>&gt;<i> from the original SN guys.
</I>&gt;<i> We felt that still a lot of people were looking at and using the
</I>&gt;<i> original SN and not using the enhanced NG version, so we made the 6.0
</I>&gt;<i> to spread the word that we are still alive and all further development
</I>&gt;<i> is done by the NG project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The original reason for restarting the development was that I go
</I>&gt;<i> frustrated with SN's flakyness and non-friendly look (the pixmaps they
</I>&gt;<i> used just carry that ancient Unix look that hurts your eyes).
</I>&gt;<i> It also used the old db-1.85 which had memory corruption issues for
</I>&gt;<i> really big projects. And the only reason why you'd use SN ARE big
</I>&gt;<i> projects you have to explore quickly (I cannot consider cscope or
</I>&gt;<i> similar stuff to be a solution to that particular problem - Source
</I>&gt;<i> Insight is rather nice, though).
</I>&gt;<i> So we took off to fix some long-standing bugs, rework the look, and
</I>&gt;<i> eventually change over to a recent db4 database library (where we
</I>&gt;<i> luckily had big contributions).
</I>&gt;<i> Mark quickly joined in the very beginning (at first contributing
</I>&gt;<i> enhanced ClearCase support) and after NG3 Maurice joined, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our focus remains to improve usability and performance. We are also
</I>&gt;<i> trying to stay as cross-platform as we can, although we fail from time
</I>&gt;<i> to time ;-) SN NG should run on major Unixes (w/ gcc at least), win32
</I>&gt;<i> (Msys/minGW) and OS X (Mark is doing the tweaking there). Our primary
</I>&gt;<i> platform stays Linux, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps, cheers and happy hacking,
</I>&gt;<i> ~F
