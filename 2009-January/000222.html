<PRE>&gt;<i> Another question, what would it take to convert this to Qt or GTK?  I would
</I>&gt;<i> be willing to help in some fashion with this, however, I don't really have
</I>&gt;<i> any experience with either.  I just recently bought the Qt 4 book by
</I>&gt;<i> Trolltech and had planned on learning Qt.  Is this something that is planned
</I>&gt;<i> for a future release?  I was looking through the code (helpfully in SN), but
</I>
We will not go gtk or qt any time soon. A lot of functionality (and
all of the gui) is written in tcl/tk, and we'd have to rewrite all of
it. While the look and feel of tcl/tk is questionable, it currently
works(TM). Also, the qt version must be called Source Qrusader, then
;)

&gt;<i> couldn't really make sense of the layout and the relationship to the GUI
</I>&gt;<i> stuff (no TCL/TK experience here either).
</I>
SN is a bitch to get into. Try starting in the snavigator/
subdirectory - snavigator/gui contains most of the gui code. But don't
expect to understand the tcl/tk - it will REALLY twist your brain.

Cheers,
~F
