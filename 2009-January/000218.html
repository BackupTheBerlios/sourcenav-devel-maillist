<PRE>Hi Ryan,

Daniel explained it correctly already. The reason for the real fork
and that we are on Berlios is that the &quot;old&quot; SN guys were a bit
hesisant to hand over the project page so I could start the SVN tree
and get things started.
The reason behind SN 6.0 (which is EXACTLY SN NG3, only with a changed
version string) is that we finally got  the SN SourceForge project
from the original SN guys.
We felt that still a lot of people were looking at and using the
original SN and not using the enhanced NG version, so we made the 6.0
to spread the word that we are still alive and all further development
is done by the NG project.

The original reason for restarting the development was that I go
frustrated with SN's flakyness and non-friendly look (the pixmaps they
used just carry that ancient Unix look that hurts your eyes).
It also used the old db-1.85 which had memory corruption issues for
really big projects. And the only reason why you'd use SN ARE big
projects you have to explore quickly (I cannot consider cscope or
similar stuff to be a solution to that particular problem - Source
Insight is rather nice, though).
So we took off to fix some long-standing bugs, rework the look, and
eventually change over to a recent db4 database library (where we
luckily had big contributions).
Mark quickly joined in the very beginning (at first contributing
enhanced ClearCase support) and after NG3 Maurice joined, too.

Our focus remains to improve usability and performance. We are also
trying to stay as cross-platform as we can, although we fail from time
to time ;-) SN NG should run on major Unixes (w/ gcc at least), win32
(Msys/minGW) and OS X (Mark is doing the tweaking there). Our primary
platform stays Linux, though.

Hope this helps, cheers and happy hacking,
~F
