<PRE>Hi,

Just a personal opinion here (and I'm just an user of SN, never worked on it), I think it's more important that the parsers get better. The GUI seems fine, from a functional point of view, and a shift to Qt or GTK wouldn't add much functionality I guess. But C++ browsing could use some improvements. &quot;Go to declaration/definition&quot; feature for example. Also regular expressions are a bit difficult to use, sometimes I just give up and use plain 'find' and 'grep' on a bash shell (even if it's a slow cygwin shell). I tried (only a little, that's true) to look into SN code but gave up (for now). When I'll have a small app to implement the 'grep in files' feature the way I would like it to be I'll get back on this subject with more then just talk.
In the mean time, I'm glad and thankfull that somebody is still working on SN. :)

Luc

Subject: Re: [SN-devel] Relationship between Source Navigator NG and Source Navigator?

Thanks for the explanation.

Another question, what would it take to convert this to Qt or GTK?  I would be willing to help in some fashion with this, however, I don't really have any experience with either.  I just recently bought the Qt 4 book by Trolltech and had planned on learning Qt.  Is this something that is planned for a future release?  I was looking through the code (helpfully in SN), but couldn't really make sense of the layout and the relationship to the GUI stuff (no TCL/TK experience here either).

Hi Ryan,

Daniel explained it correctly already. The reason for the real fork
and that we are on Berlios is that the &quot;old&quot; SN guys were a bit
hesisant to hand over the project page so I could start the SVN tree
and get things started.
The reason behind SN 6.0 (which is EXACTLY SN NG3, only with a changed
version string) is that we finally got  the SN SourceForge project
from the original SN guys.
We felt that still a lot of people were looking at and using the
original SN and not using the enhanced NG version, so we made the 6.0
to spread the word that we are still alive and all further development
is done by the NG project.

The original reason for restarting the development was that I go
frustrated with SN's flakyness and non-friendly look (the pixmaps they
used just carry that ancient Unix look that hurts your eyes).
It also used the old db-1.85 which had memory corruption issues for
really big projects. And the only reason why you'd use SN ARE big
projects you have to explore quickly (I cannot consider cscope or
similar stuff to be a solution to that particular problem - Source
Insight is rather nice, though).
So we took off to fix some long-standing bugs, rework the look, and
eventually change over to a recent db4 database library (where we
luckily had big contributions).
Mark quickly joined in the very beginning (at first contributing
enhanced ClearCase support) and after NG3 Maurice joined, too.

Our focus remains to improve usability and performance. We are also
trying to stay as cross-platform as we can, although we fail from time
to time ;-) SN NG should run on major Unixes (w/ gcc at least), win32
(Msys/minGW) and OS X (Mark is doing the tweaking there). Our primary
platform stays Linux, though.

Hope this helps, cheers and happy hacking,
~F
