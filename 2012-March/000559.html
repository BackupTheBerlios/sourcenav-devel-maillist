<PRE>Hi Earnie,

&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Ubuntu is not Linux anymore
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you mean by that statement? &#160;Just wondering since it seems to
</I>&gt;<i> be a favorite for hosting providers.
</I>
Well, Ubuntu undoubtedly merges a lot of funny patches and moves
userland and &quot;configuration&quot; where no Unix belongs (not personal
taste, but in a wider concept).

Further, I also consider Ubuntu as &quot;not Linux&quot; as they extensively
seem try to confine users in a kind of Ubuntu universe, where a &quot;under
Ubuntu, do the following commands and it works&quot; is prevalent; most of
these solutions are ugly workarounds where no explanation is given WHY
this should work and how, and 99% of those are not repeatable on ANY
Unix or any other specific version than the current one.
Also, this is the expectation of ANY user I've seen: &quot;just give me a
couple of commands and changes and go fix your package&quot; - they do not
participate in the development process.

As a developer of a major package (yes, a hacky one, but that were the
people before us) this is just a pain in the ass. We've devoted a lot
of time and energy (NG1 and NG4!), we're willing to help and to merge
and test patches (and many of you have sent patches that went in).

But I'm more than ignorant of _individual_ problems of persons that
only want _one quick_ _individual fix_ _without participating_ in
making the whole package _better for everybody_ .
This seems to be prevalent in Ubuntu users, and I'm sticking with that
opinion unless I'm proven wrong by a lot of people and positive
experiences.

On a more personal level, &quot;if it compiles and runs under RHEL AND my
own Linux from Scratch, it's perfect&quot;.

Cheers,
F
</PRE>
