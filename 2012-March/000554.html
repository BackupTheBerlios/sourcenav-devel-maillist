<PRE>Hi again,

please let me kindly ask you to only post in plain text without any
attachments, signatures and full quoting - it makes replying pretty
hard.

&gt;<i> is the windows branch maintained at the moment by your team?
</I>
Yes, more or less we're trying to support Windows, Mark also tries to
do OSX. I'm of course developing under Linux, which has been the
platform with the best coverage and least problems. Most SN users
actually seem to be Windows users using our binary distribution. I've
merged some Solaris and even HPUX patches, but that was a long time
ago. I'd love to do Alpha again, but...

&gt;<i> At the moment I try to compile the current SN-NG4.4 sourcecode from trunk with mingw under winxp. But it seems, that it's not
</I>&gt;<i> compilable without any sourcecode changes.
</I>&gt;<i> I had to do some code modifications at \tcl\win\tclWinReg.c and  \tcl\win\tclWinDde.c to fix compiler errors, but now the
</I>&gt;<i> compiler halted at db4\mutex\mut_failchk.c...
</I>
Yes; you also must specify --enable-mingw to configure.
There has been a patch somewhere, and the MinGW-people were very
helpful there, but I haven't gotten around merging it.

Cheers,
F
