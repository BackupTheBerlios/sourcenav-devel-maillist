<PRE>&gt;<i> you make me curious. You seem to have a clear picture on
</I>&gt;<i> why one shouldn't go with SF (or at least why you wouldn't).
</I>&gt;<i> Can you share any details?
</I>
Frankly - SF is hosted in the USA, so we lousy Europeans ;) have some
privacy concerns, and latency is bad for us.
Also we'd like to go with something a little more &quot;lightweight&quot; than
the whole SF stuff, which I personally find hard to use and navigate
nowadays.
The service and stability has gotten very very good, though, so that's
not a blocker.

Cheers,
F
