<PRE>How about .edu sites

And it might provide some opportunities for students to contribute as well

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Frankly - SF is hosted in the USA, so we lousy Europeans ;) have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some privacy concerns, and latency is bad for us. Also we'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; go with something a little more &quot;lightweight&quot; than the whole SF
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stuff, which I personally find hard to use and navigate nowadays. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; service and stability has gotten very very good, though, so that's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not a blocker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My experience with SF has been they are ever changing and what I might
</I>&gt;<i> put in place today in the form of scripting could need changed tomorrow
</I>&gt;<i> just because of a new SF release.  That and the FRS is still cumbersome
</I>&gt;<i> to use.  What this project needs is mainly a VCS, some email list
</I>&gt;<i> software, bug tracking, a wiki and a means to distribute files.  All
</I>&gt;<i> those can be provided with a host service provider.  NetworkRedux uses
</I>&gt;<i> Linux and Cloud technology to allow you to grow as needed and they have
</I>&gt;<i> services located in both USA and Europe with 22 NR:CDN service points
</I>&gt;<i> around the world.  I haven't looked at Google's offerings to comment on it.
