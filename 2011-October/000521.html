<PRE>Hi,

I have been trying to get it to work well on Windows, but I am afraid I am
failing miserably.

The first thing I did was to upgrade IncrTcl/Tk to latest in the 3.x branch,
which also required a couple changes in incrTcl classes that were pretty
ancient, but fortunately nothing big.

But that didn't fix the crashes, so I started fixing the compile warnings,
till I got to the warnings in tkTable, since that is an independent Tk
extension, I upgraded it too.

I fixed all the warnings I could, mainly adding a lot of 'CONST' , not all
since I am not much of a C expert, but the programs keeps crashing in
Windows and the some of the icons keep looking blurred.

If anyone has any idea about how to debug it to pinpoint the cause of
the crashes, I would love to hear it.

If you want to take it for a spin, you can find it here:

<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/getleftdown/files/SourceNavigator-Tryouts/SourceNavigator-NG-8.4-2.tar.gz/download">http://sourceforge.net/projects/getleftdown/files/SourceNavigator-Tryouts/SourceNavigator-NG-8.4-2.tar.gz/download</A>

Like the former versions, it seems to work fine in Linux.

Andres
