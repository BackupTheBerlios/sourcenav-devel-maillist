<PRE>Hi,

I have more or less got Source Navigator to work with Tcl/Tk 8.4, 
actually it is
8.4.19, the lastest that was released, plus some bug fixes.

8.5 would be better but, I am afraid that the internals of the text 
widget
have changed a lot, so I think that 8.4 is a good stepping stone to 
get
there eventually.

I have also added the tile extension for ttk widgets support and 
ported
the startup dialog to choose projects to use them. In Linux there 
isn't
much of a difference but it should be huge in Windows.

You can download it at:

<A HREF="https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/getleftdown/SourceNavigator-">https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/getleftdown/SourceNavigator-</A>
NG-8.4.tar.gz?r=&amp;ts=1318608741&amp;use_mirror=master

Now for the bad news:

I only compiled it in Linux, considering what it took to get it to 
work, compiling it
in Windows is likely to take a lot of work.

I updated Tix, but by the time I had found a newer incrtTcl/Tk I had 
already got
the old one to work, so I didn't update it.

It seems to work, at least in Linux it does, but I would be surprised 
if there were
no regressions.

Getting all of SN to use ttk widgets is likely to be some work too, do 
you
think it would be worth it?

Regards,
Andres
