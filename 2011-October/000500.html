My experience with SF has been they are ever changing and what I might
put in place today in the form of scripting could need changed tomorrow
just because of a new SF release.  That and the FRS is still cumbersome
to use.  What this project needs is mainly a VCS, some email list
software, bug tracking, a wiki and a means to distribute files.  All
those can be provided with a host service provider.  NetworkRedux uses
Linux and Cloud technology to allow you to grow as needed and they have
services located in both USA and Europe with 22 NR:CDN service points
around the world.  I haven't looked at Google's offerings to comment on it.
