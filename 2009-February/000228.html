<PRE>Dear all,

version NG4 has just been released. You can find it at

<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8334">http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8334</A>

There you will find the source and a win32 i686 binary
package.

SVN people can switch to (or checkout) the following URL:

<A HREF="https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/sourcenav/tags/SN-NG4">https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/sourcenav/tags/SN-NG4</A>

This release has gotten about one year of development and constant
usage by our group.
Quite a few bugs were fixed, building under win32/minGW is supported
out of the box now (but we broke Solaris instead), and we have a new
and fresh look. XEmacs functionality was enhanced and a bug with the
parsing was fixed when dealing with CR-LF based files.
win32 people using batch processing will find it convenient that
snavigator.exe will exit only AFTER the batch job has finished (as it
does with Unix).
Also the whole directory structure was reworked and we are slowly
moving towards fsstnd compliance.


Contributions were done by and I'd like to express my gratitude
towards (I hope I don't forget anybody):
Mark Thornber (as always, core member)
Maurice Havelday (new core member, did php4 classes full support and
misc. improvements)
Timo Korvola (XEmacs enhancements)
Earnie Boyd (minGW compile fix direction-pointing)

Cheers and happy xref'ing,
Freek

</PRE>
