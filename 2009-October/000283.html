<PRE>Hi all,

unfortunately this &quot;bug&quot; is rather well-known to me, at least in the
pre-db4-days.

I had it debugged back then (5.x series) and came to the conclusion
that the db-1.85 library was somehow corrupting memory on bigger
projects (esp. when run with bigger caches, etc.).
I also thought we had put this bug to rest by migrating to db4.

However your bug report is very good, as for example I could not
really pin in down to a certain &quot;do this and that and then SN will
crash&quot; scenario. For me it also frequently occured when saving files
while having multiple panes open.

We will look into this as soon as our time allows this. Mark also
seems to have risen from the ashes ;-)
Cheers and thanks,
~F
