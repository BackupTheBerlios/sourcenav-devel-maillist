<PRE>Hi Medi,

unfortunately this bug has been present from the very start; it's way
worse on Windows, but there are situations when also on *nix there's
an unacceptable delay.
You are right - the is much going on behind the scenes. A huge list of
files (to parse afaik) is compiled and written out to a file.
This condition even is documented in SN's source (I currently can't
remember where - it's a delayed mapping of a dialogue window and the
comment even explicitly mentions windows).

The code that is triggered by &quot;Reparse project&quot; is found here:
snavigator/gui/preferences, line 1222

As for seeing what's going on, try starting snavigator with the
cmdline switch &quot;--debug 99&quot;. A file zznavig.log will appear in your
current directory, and lots of output on your console.

Over the years I've tried a few things but none of them seems to
really work. It has brought me a great deal of pain not being able to
fix it.
You're welcome to try and find a new fix :-)

Sorry I couldn't really help.

Cheers,
F
