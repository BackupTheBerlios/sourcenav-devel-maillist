<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I am having trouble with the xref component, it does not work for calls.
</I>&gt;<i> The xref panel shows who calls the function but not who the function
</I>&gt;<i> calls. All it shows are (t) typedefs, not very useful..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know this used to work under 4,5 up to 5.1.1
</I>
Can you provide us with sample code that fails in that area? That's
very important! We did already fix some nasty issues with the parsers
and this will help us understand the problem. And I collect those code
samples for future testing.

&gt;<i> Also grep functionality is broken.. assignment search does nothing
</I>&gt;<i> sensible and the others seem to do nothing either, this is with NG3 on
</I>&gt;<i> linux and windows.
</I>
Mark's our man for that and he did some patches in that area I just
merged without looking or testing so that's probably my fault ;)

&gt;<i> To be blunt this makes sourcenav useless as a code visualization/rework
</I>&gt;<i> tool, and pretty gui editors I already have. I will keep using 5.1.1 but
</I>&gt;<i> this fork is broken... fix it or let it die.
</I>
I do understand you general frustration when things suddenly don't
work you come to like, but let's work together fixing those problems.
You have to consider that SN is a huge pile of hacked-together mess.
Code flow sometimes isn't even recognizable anymore and when I tried
to generalize some duplicated code SN suddenly wouldn't start up
anymore due to some sideeffects the original code had.

&gt;<i>  I also built an SV6 and have no problems with this doing xref searches.
</I>
What's SV6 ?

Cheers,
~F
