Submission of Summaries

Tcl/Tk 2010 will be held in Chicago/Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois USA
from October 11 - 15, 2010. The program committee is asking for papers
and presentation proposals from anyone using or developing with Tcl/Tk
(and extensions). Past conferences have seen submissions covering a
wide variety of topics including:

* Scientific and engineering applications
* Industrial controls
* Distributed applications and Network Managment
* Object oriented extensions to Tcl/Tk
* New widgets for Tk
* Simulation and application steering with Tcl/Tk
* Tcl/Tk-centric operating environments
* Tcl/Tk on small and embedded devices
* Medical applications and visualization
* Use of different programming paradigms in Tcl/Tk and proposals for new
 directions.
* New areas of exploration for the Tcl/Tk language

This year is the third year that the Tcl community is participating in
the Google Summer of Code.  The conference program committee would
like to encourage submissions that report on the Tcl projects selected
for Google SoC 2010.

Submissions should consist of an abstract of about 100 words and a
summary of not more than two pages, and should be sent as plain text
to &lt;tclconference AT googlegroups DOT com&gt; no later than August 15,
2010. Authors of accepted abstracts will have until October 1, 2010 to
submit their final paper for the inclusion in the conference
proceedings. The proceedings will be made available on digital media,
so extra materials such as presentation slides, code examples, code
for extensions etc. are encouraged.

Printed proceedings will be produced as an on-demand book at lulu.com

The authors will have 25 minutes to present their paper at the
conference.

The program committee will review and evaluate papers according to the
following criteria:

* Quantity and quality of novel content
* Relevance and interest to the Tcl/Tk community
* Suitability of content for presentation at the conference

Proposals may report on commercial or non-commercial systems, but
those with only blatant marketing content will not be accepted.

Application and experience papers need to strike a balance between
background on the application domain and the relevance of Tcl/Tk to
the application. Application and experience papers should clearly
explain how the application or experience illustrates a novel use of
Tcl/Tk, and what lessons the Tcl/Tk community can derive from the
application or experience to apply to their own development efforts.

Papers accompanied by non-disclosure agreements will be returned to
the author(s) unread. All submissions are held in the highest
confidentiality prior to publication in the Proceedings, both as a
matter of policy and in accord with the U. S. Copyright Act of 1976.

The primary author for each accepted paper will receive registration
to the Technical Sessions portion of the conference at a reduced rate.

Other Forms of Participation

The program committee also welcomes proposals for panel discussions of
up to 90 minutes. Proposals should include a list of confirmed
panelists, a title and format, and a panel description with position
statements from each panelist. Panels should have no more than four
speakers, including the panel moderator, and should allow time for
substantial interaction with attendees. Panels are not presentations
of related research papers.

Slots for Works-in-Progress (WIP) presentations and Birds-of-a-Feather
sessions (BOFs) are available on a first-come, first-served basis
starting in August 1, 2010. Specific instructions for reserving WIP
and BOF time slots will be provided in the registration information
available in June 2010. Some WIP and BOF time slots will be held open
for on-site reservation. All attendees with an interesting work in
progress should consider reserving a WIP slot.

Registration Information

More information on the conference is available the conference Web
site (<A HREF="http://www.tcl.tk/community/tcl2010/">http://www.tcl.tk/community/tcl2010/</A>) and will be published on
