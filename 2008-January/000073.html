<PRE>Quoting Freek &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sourcenav-devel">freequaos at gmail.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> Great Earnie, thanks!
</I>&gt;<i> Did you ever manage to crash the thing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I tested on a php project named Drupal.  I had added file suffixes to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the list of php files and saved it, even made it the default.  I tried
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reparsing the project but it didn't pick up the new files.  I had to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delete the project and try again for it to find the files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We didn't touch the configuration system at all, it might be an old
</I>&gt;<i> bug that didn't refresh those parts of SN when altering them. I'll
</I>&gt;<i> keep it in mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Please do.

&gt;<i> Which file extensions did you add?
</I>&gt;<i> I've just added .php3 and .php4 for the phpbrowser into the default
</I>&gt;<i> configuration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Interesting things to Drupal like .inc, .lib, .module, .install, 
.schema and maybe a couple of others.

&gt;&gt;<i> It does parse faster and respond faster.  And the functions have been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> identified and cross referenced correctly.  Drupal doesn't use classes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so I don't have a test of that yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On *nix my feeling is that the initial parsing is a bit slower (esp.
</I>&gt;<i> on big projects) while retrieving data has gotten much faster.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The retrieving part is what needs to be faster in my opinion.  The 
parsing can be slower if better user experience is given on the UI side.

&gt;<i> I also've no idea if the phpbrowser already supports classes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I looked once but I forget.  I'll have to give it a try with a package 
that has them, I'll let you know.
