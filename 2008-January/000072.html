<PRE>Great Earnie, thanks!
Did you ever manage to crash the thing?


&gt;<i> I tested on a php project named Drupal.  I had added file suffixes to
</I>&gt;<i> the list of php files and saved it, even made it the default.  I tried
</I>&gt;<i> reparsing the project but it didn't pick up the new files.  I had to
</I>&gt;<i> delete the project and try again for it to find the files.
</I>
We didn't touch the configuration system at all, it might be an old
bug that didn't refresh those parts of SN when altering them. I'll
keep it in mind.

Which file extensions did you add?
I've just added .php3 and .php4 for the phpbrowser into the default
configuration.

&gt;<i> It does parse faster and respond faster.  And the functions have been
</I>&gt;<i> identified and cross referenced correctly.  Drupal doesn't use classes
</I>&gt;<i> so I don't have a test of that yet.
</I>
On *nix my feeling is that the initial parsing is a bit slower (esp.
on big projects) while retrieving data has gotten much faster.

I also've no idea if the phpbrowser already supports classes.

Cheers,
F
