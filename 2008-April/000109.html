<PRE>It's a custom lock that's inside of the database and it won't respect a reboot. 

If it was a unix box, it should have just opened the database. 

For example, I just shot hyper leaving my database locked. Then I restarted sn with debugging turned on.

When I selected that locked database I saw the following message:

	Project is used by: sourcenav-0 31556 tux unknown 0

Then it proceeded to open the project since that pid wasn't alive on my system. I think it also checks whether the pid is &quot;hyper&quot; just in case the pid was recycled by the os for another process. If debugging isn't on, it just opens the db.

I suspect that the file locking that is used was a compromise for something that was portable across various unix and windows platforms.

Is this a unix type platform that you are having trouble with or windows? It should do the right thing on unix. If someone knows how to do the right thing on windows, it should be pretty easy as well.
