<PRE>&gt;<i>  Congrats on getting this old puppy back to life. I really like it, and
</I>&gt;<i>  would like to use it more.
</I>&gt;<i>  Let me start by saying that i think the work that has been put into NG3
</I>&gt;<i>  is really great. The tool is much more stable and responsive than in
</I>&gt;<i>  NG1. Great work! There are however a few annoying bugs that i run in to
</I>&gt;<i>  from time to time:
</I>
I'd like to request such kind of backrubbing more often :-) Is good to
know the hard work is still appreciated.

&gt;<i>  1) Is there no bug-database to collect info. It would be a big help i
</I>&gt;<i>  think.
</I>
For a short while there was such a thing; didn't do us any favour at all.
It's psychological thing, the user dumps the bug into the DB and
magically expects it to suddenly disappear by an eager developer.

We try to use a more directly involving approach - get the user to
submit patches, get the user to work directly with us, let him stay a
bit more active and post onto the ML.

Thing is, both Mark and me are terribly busy. We barely get the things
done we've set our mind on to change in SN NG back when we started.

&gt;<i>  2) I often end up in a situation where i get the dreaded &quot;User 'unknown'
</I>&gt;<i>  already has the project &lt;path&gt; open on the system &lt;system&gt;&quot;, which
</I>&gt;<i>  prevents me from opening the project. Probably happens after i shut the
</I>&gt;<i>  program down brutally. This should probably be fixed, so i don't have to
</I>&gt;<i>  delete the databases all the time. Maybe a GUI where the user could
</I>&gt;<i>  over-ride would be smart (sort of like VI does).
</I>
This is a new one. Please make a new post with as much information
(platform, version, what you're doing, the debug logs) as you can
gather, so we can track the issue under this new thread.

&gt;<i>  3) The source package still contains its own version of tcl/tk. I think
</I>&gt;<i>  it could become very attractive for distributions to once again include
</I>&gt;<i>  source-navigator, if this was resolved. I don't think distros like
</I>&gt;<i>  packages that forces the user to install outdated versions of other
</I>&gt;<i>  packages. I would love get SN via YUM or apt-get in the future!
</I>
This is not a big showstopper for inclusion into repositories: SN is
strictly linked statically against tcl/tk so it doesn't disturb other
packages. The packager can even remove those static libs (they're
provided to have a full SDK included) for a &quot;run-only&quot; package.

However, yes - we WERE thinking about removing the &quot;own&quot; version of
tcl/tk or upgrading the supplied version to 8.4 but then SN is hugely
version depended on the version of tcl/tk by using itcl and also some
custom widgets libraries.
Which all blows up big time when doing a switch to 8.4 (or even using
the underlying OS's version).
So we came to the conclusion to NOT change this at the moment.

&gt;<i>  4) There is a small but funny bug in the help menu, as it tries to use
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;netscape&quot; to look up the website. I don't think people have netscape
</I>&gt;<i>  anymore. Should probably be a list of clients to try, where &quot;firefox&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  and &quot;mozilla&quot; should be among them (maybe also popular gnome and KDE
</I>&gt;<i>  browsers).
</I>
That I will try to fix in the source this week :)
There are even a few hardcoded references to netscape which I will
also remove.

Hope my post wasn't too disappointing. It's just that we basically are
2 guys here... for example, without Aurelian the switch to db4
would've taken also much longer!
I've also promised updates to php for Earnie which I still haven't
gotten around doing.

Cheers,
~F
