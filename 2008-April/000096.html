Hello Source Navigators!

Congrats on getting this old puppy back to life. I really like it, and
would like to use it more. 

Let me start by saying that i think the work that has been put into NG3
is really great. The tool is much more stable and responsive than in
NG1. Great work! There are however a few annoying bugs that i run in to
from time to time:

1) Is there no bug-database to collect info. It would be a big help i
think.

2) I often end up in a situation where i get the dreaded &quot;User 'unknown'
already has the project &lt;path&gt; open on the system &lt;system&gt;&quot;, which
prevents me from opening the project. Probably happens after i shut the
program down brutally. This should probably be fixed, so i don't have to
delete the databases all the time. Maybe a GUI where the user could
over-ride would be smart (sort of like VI does).

3) The source package still contains its own version of tcl/tk. I think
it could become very attractive for distributions to once again include
source-navigator, if this was resolved. I don't think distros like
packages that forces the user to install outdated versions of other
packages. I would love get SN via YUM or apt-get in the future!

4) There is a small but funny bug in the help menu, as it tries to use
&quot;netscape&quot; to look up the website. I don't think people have netscape
anymore. Should probably be a list of clients to try, where &quot;firefox&quot;
and &quot;mozilla&quot; should be among them (maybe also popular gnome and KDE
browsers).

5) Opening files in &quot;grep&quot; is fairly slow, even on my 3GHz machine.
Could this somehow be optimized? I understand the search takes time, but
sometimes opening the file takes longer than the search! :-)

Thanks,

/Peter
