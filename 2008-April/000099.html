In my case i was talking more about the time it actually takes to open
the source file when i click it (from the list of files found during
grep). But of-course the grep itself could also be improved. 

&gt;<i> The question is how to improve that. I think one key

Personally i use it for both. I often re-base the code via git, cvs or svn,
and then search again with SN-grep.

&gt;<i>From my point of view the point about TCL/TK is important. If others are going

SN still uses these old versions. The problem is that most programmers
do not want to work with old versions of anything. Lets say that want to 
improve SN by fixing a bug in TCL or TK

Normally you would have to:

1) Convince TCL/TK devs to fix it (or send patch)....
2) Wait for automatic update in your distro (or upgrade manually).

But here you have to:

1) Convince TCL/TK devs to fix it (or send patch)....
2) Backport fix to older version, which could give some headaches.
3) Convince SN devs to include fix in their special version.

The second path is not desirable for many reasons. One good reason is that
it gives poor quality, as only the small team using SN gets to verify
and test the changes. If its changed on TCL/TK mainline it is theoretically 
verified by millions.
