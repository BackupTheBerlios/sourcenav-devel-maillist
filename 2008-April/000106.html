<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;  2) I often end up in a situation where i get the dreaded &quot;User 'unknown'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  already has the project &lt;path&gt; open on the system &lt;system&gt;&quot;, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  prevents me from opening the project. Probably happens after i shut the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  program down brutally. This should probably be fixed, so i don't have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  delete the databases all the time. Maybe a GUI where the user could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  over-ride would be smart (sort of like VI does).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a new one. Please make a new post with as much information
</I>&gt;<i> (platform, version, what you're doing, the debug logs) as you can
</I>&gt;<i> gather, so we can track the issue under this new thread.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
This is something that was worked on a bit a few years ago. I submitted some code that handled it (for me) on Linux. As a matter of fact, I saw it pop up the other day when I tried to open a database that I was building in another window and it told me that I already had it open. If the process that holds the lock is still alive, it prevents you from taking it.

From the message you describe, you might be on a windows box? The stuff I worked on knows nothing about checking for ownership on windows. It would be pretty easy to change the popup into a question asking if you want to override the lock.
