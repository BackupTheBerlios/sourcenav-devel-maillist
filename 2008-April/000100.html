<PRE>2008/4/28 Peter Dons Tychsen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sourcenav-devel">donpedro at tdcadsl.dk</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i>  &gt;From my point of view the point about TCL/TK is important. If others are going
</I>&gt;<i>  to contribute with patches and code, i think it is a show-stopper that
</I>&gt;<i>  SN still uses these old versions. The problem is that most programmers
</I>&gt;<i>  do not want to work with old versions of anything. Lets say that want to
</I>&gt;<i>  improve SN by fixing a bug in TCL or TK
</I>I agree with the principle of having dependencies on packages provided
by others - as long as there is a good package manager available - and
all target platforms provide the same level of functionality.

However - we are where we are due to historical reasons.  I started
using SN in 1998 (before it went open source) and I suspect the idea
of bundling Tcl/Tk etc was to provide an easy installation -
especially on Windows.  10 years on and package managers have improved
but I'm still not sure that there is an easy way to install the
dependencies on a Windows platform.

Also, AFAIKR, Tcl/Tk was 'fluid' at that time and having Tcl/Tk
bundled in would have made SN more stable and insulated from the
changes happening in the Tcl/Tk world.  Another consideration is
whether the original developers tweaked the Tcl/Tk distribution for
their own reasons.

Having said all that we do want to move forward to later versions of
Tcl/Tk but we felt that getting a stable backend database was top of
the list.
