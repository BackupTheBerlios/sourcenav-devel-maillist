<PRE>Hello Mark,

&gt;<i> However - we are where we are due to historical reasons.  I started
</I>&gt;<i> using SN in 1998 (before it went open source) and I suspect the idea
</I>&gt;<i> of bundling Tcl/Tk etc was to provide an easy installation -
</I>&gt;<i> especially on Windows.  10 years on and package managers have improved
</I>&gt;<i> but I'm still not sure that there is an easy way to install the
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies on a Windows platform.
</I>Yes, this is absolutely true. Windows is always a wildcard when it comes
to installation of packages which are dependent on other packages. I do
think however that this should be solved in the Windows installer for
the given program and not by the program itself. As an example, GIMP and
other GTK based programs bundle GTK+ and other gnome libs in the
installer in Windows, but not in Unix.

&gt;<i> Also, AFAIKR, Tcl/Tk was 'fluid' at that time and having Tcl/Tk
</I>&gt;<i> bundled in would have made SN more stable and insulated from the
</I>&gt;<i> changes happening in the Tcl/Tk world.  Another consideration is
</I>&gt;<i> whether the original developers tweaked the Tcl/Tk distribution for
</I>&gt;<i> their own reasons.
</I>True. I do have the feeling however that TCL/TK is pretty locked down 
now (i hope).

&gt;<i> Having said all that we do want to move forward to later versions of
</I>&gt;<i> Tcl/Tk but we felt that getting a stable backend database was top of
</I>&gt;<i> the list.
</I>Great. I might even pitch in with some patches if i can find the time.

Anyway, i love the tool and your work on it!

/P
