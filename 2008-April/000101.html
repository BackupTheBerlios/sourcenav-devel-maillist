<PRE>Quoting Mark Thornber &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sourcenav-devel">mark.thornber at gmail.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> 2008/4/28 Peter Dons Tychsen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sourcenav-devel">donpedro at tdcadsl.dk</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;From my point of view the point about TCL/TK is important. If 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> others are going
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  to contribute with patches and code, i think it is a show-stopper that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  SN still uses these old versions. The problem is that most programmers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  do not want to work with old versions of anything. Lets say that want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  improve SN by fixing a bug in TCL or TK
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with the principle of having dependencies on packages provided
</I>&gt;<i> by others - as long as there is a good package manager available - and
</I>&gt;<i> all target platforms provide the same level of functionality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However - we are where we are due to historical reasons.  I started
</I>&gt;<i> using SN in 1998 (before it went open source) and I suspect the idea
</I>&gt;<i> of bundling Tcl/Tk etc was to provide an easy installation -
</I>&gt;<i> especially on Windows.  10 years on and package managers have improved
</I>&gt;<i> but I'm still not sure that there is an easy way to install the
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies on a Windows platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'll suggest Cygwin's setup.exe which is FOSS.  It may need to be 
modified some to fit but dependency checking is already programmed.  It 
is all controlled via setup.ini and setup.hint for the dependency 
package.

&gt;<i> Also, AFAIKR, Tcl/Tk was 'fluid' at that time and having Tcl/Tk
</I>&gt;<i> bundled in would have made SN more stable and insulated from the
</I>&gt;<i> changes happening in the Tcl/Tk world.  Another consideration is
</I>&gt;<i> whether the original developers tweaked the Tcl/Tk distribution for
</I>&gt;<i> their own reasons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think it was both reasons but primarily the latter.  I remember 
trying a long while ago breaking out tcl/tk and other pieces but didn't 
get very far (I didn't have the time to spend).

&gt;<i> Having said all that we do want to move forward to later versions of
</I>&gt;<i> Tcl/Tk but we felt that getting a stable backend database was top of
</I>&gt;<i> the list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, that would be more important.  Another decision that might need to 
be considered is do we stick with TCL/TK or move to say Ruby, Python, 
or something else.  Both Ruby and Python could provide net appliances 
that could be useful for collaborative work.
