<PRE>I've just installed Source Navigator NG3 on a Linux 2.4 system. It seems
to basically work for me but I've noticed the following problem.

 

This is with the C language.

 

When using the Xref facility I can see the tree of routine calls using
&quot;Referred to&quot; and &quot;Referred from&quot; but the tool doesn't seem to
understand that routines can be referenced indirectly.

 

If a routine has something like:

 

foo = some_routine_name;

 

in it then somewhere there is:

 

int some_routine_name(int x, int y)

{

  ...

}

 

And the routine is declared in a .h file it gets symbolized correctly as
a &quot;fd&quot; in the .h file and an fu in the .c file. BUT for the original
referece if I click on the reference it ends up saying it is a &quot;ud&quot; i.e.
undefined. That reference gets treated as a leaf and doesn't refer down
to the routine declaration. I guess that is somewhat understandable
because it is not &quot;called&quot; from the point of reference. But all the same
it is annoying when you use the XREF facility to find references.

 

Is this a bug or is this functioning as intended?

 

Also as a sub question I was looking for a way to search  this
distribution list archive to see if anybody else had previously asked
this question but couldn't see how to do it. So apologies if this has
already been discussed.

 

Regards,

 

Dave Garrod
