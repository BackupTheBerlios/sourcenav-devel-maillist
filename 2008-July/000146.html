<PRE>&gt;<i>  &gt; If you're talking about function pointers and the like, then - yes.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Can you maybe provide a small .c program which we can parse in SN and
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; check for the exact problem you have? That would be most helpful!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Yes it is function pointers I'm talking about. At the end of this reply is an example.
</I>
Great, thanks for the example! I think we should include this as a
test case or something.

There is somewhere in the parser or main sourcenav directory a README
file detailing SN's shortcomings. Function pointers are one of those
and well-known right from the start.

&gt;<i>  If I go into XREF for b1() it shows it is called from a(). But it does not show that
</I>&gt;<i>  b2() is called from a. Instead it invents thing UD thing called b2 in the context of a()
</I>&gt;<i>  Going to the XREF of b2() says that b2(fu) has NO referred by references.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Interesting enough if I look at the call graph of a() I get:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  a(fu) &lt;-- r main(fu)
</I>&gt;<i>         --&gt; r b0(fu)
</I>&gt;<i>         --&gt; r b1(fu)
</I>&gt;<i>         --&gt; r b2(ud)
</I>&gt;<i>         --&gt; rw b2P(gv)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Why can't SN work out that the b2 referenced in a() is the function b2() defined
</I>&gt;<i>  in b.c?
</I>
If I'm not misunderstanding you:
Because SN doesn't really know. How should she (SN is a she, I'm sure
of it) know?
She doesn't know compile units and its corresponding programm
namespaces, and while she COULD know include hierarchies, she doesn't
really use them when generating Xrefs (IIRC).
All that counts is the symbol's NAME.
That's why the &quot;there are more than one definition of the function -
please select&quot; dialogue comes up from time to time.

&gt;<i>  If it did then b2(fu) would have a &quot;referred by&quot; reference. Instead there is this
</I>&gt;<i>  Undefined b2(ud) in a() that is an orphan.
</I>
We have to take a closer look at this problem; but I can tell you upfront:
the problem is complex, we haven't even touched any of those areas
(parsing, Xref) yet and possibly there will be no fix in the
forseeable future. There's simply to much other more basic stuff to be
done. win32 eg still is a big problem.

If YOU want to work on that area you proposed you are warmly welcomed
and we could more than use your powers :-)

Cheers,
~F
