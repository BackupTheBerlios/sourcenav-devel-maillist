<PRE>Dear all,

Source Navigator NG4.3 has been released. It is the continuation of
the very stable NG4 series and took just about 11 months of
development.


Fixes:

- Fix greppane to edit jump, when line contains multiple &quot;:&quot;
The grep output line was split in a very wrong way (bad regexps),
which confused SN's jump to line feature. The regexp has been
rewritten, and now at least &quot;:&quot; won't confuse SN anymore.
Thanks to Markus Magnusson for reporting and testing.
- Fix snpdbg startup on win32 (the SN Parser DeBuGger)
- Fix missing maximize buttons, which seems to only manifest in KDE &gt;
3.1.x or similar desktop environments


Enhancements:

- Sort startup project selection list alphanumerically, instead of
recently used.
- DB4 was updated from 4.6.x to 4.8.30, which is the latest version
before Oracle renamed it in their weird 11x style. This should help
performance a little bit as well as certain non-optimal behaviour in
certain corner cases.
- DB4 's version is now displayed on startup.
- Include &quot;dbcompact&quot;, a database optimization (&quot;compaction&quot;) utility
for db4 databases.
It will call db4's db-&gt;compact() function which moves database pages,
optimizes the btree, and reorganizes free space so that free
pages/space can be returned to the file system.
Here's a short example on SN's trunk source:

#&gt; du -sk SNDB4/
223576  total

#&gt; dbcompact SNDB4/*

#&gt; du -sk SNDB4/
138932  total

dbcompact can speed up long-used SN db files which have been rewritten
again and again through file saves or refreshes, where performance can
decline over time due to a highly fragmented tree.
dbcompact can be found in the $SN/libexec/snavigator directory.

Regressions:

- The Java parser seemingly has an acute case of bitrot; it will no
longer function properly.
Esp. recent (1.5, 1.6) Java source code seems to trigger these bugs hard.
- On OS X, SN will crash on project creation (well known
malloc()/free() problem):
hyper(89427) malloc: *** error for object 0x7fff5fbff958: pointer
being freed was not allocated

Up until now we were unable to even fix the worst problems here.


Obtaining SN NG:

SVN people can switch to (or checkout) the following URL:
<A HREF="https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/sourcenav/tags/SN-NG4.3">https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/sourcenav/tags/SN-NG4.3</A>

Tarballs and binary builds may follow in the next couple of days here:
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8334">http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8334</A>

As always - we're still looking for help and volunteers. I'm
desperately looking for a win32 guy who can help me build and test
under win32.
Mark also reported a few problems under  win7, so if you can help out
there please drop a mail.

Cheers,
Freek
