<PRE>Hi Earnie, all,

&gt;<i> Indeed, does this mean that sourcenav will remain with BerliOS?
</I>
Mark and I are very open to stay at berlios - despite the breakin a
year ago or so it has been proven very stable, dependable, easy and
fast over the years.

While being able to have more than one repository (code.google,
github, gitorious) might be nice, it doesn't really help if you can't
set this to &quot;private&quot;, so we can try without being laughed upon ;)
Also it's very difficult to do plain HTML hosting on these platforms.

We might use 2 places in the end where we host our code, for
redundancy purposes for example or to take load off of berlios for our
downloads.

Cheers,
F
