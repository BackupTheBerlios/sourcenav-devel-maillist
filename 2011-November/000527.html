<PRE>&gt;<i> Maybe rsync to the old SF project?
</I>
We've decided to leave the old SF project for legacy purposes. SF is
rather slow for me, for some reason or the other. You can access all
the old code, tags and branches there and download the latest version
(6.0), which is a rebranded NG3 and fully compatible with SN's old
versions, but of course not NG4 and later.

&gt;<i> BTW, if you need a build bot check <A HREF="http://nixos.org/hydra/">http://nixos.org/hydra/</A> which
</I>&gt;<i> supports Linux, Mac and Windows builds.
</I>
Not yet, we don't do continuous stuff for now. I don't even have a
windows machine anymore.
But thanks for the pointer, I wasn't aware of Hydra, only the
well-known Cruise Control (ughx) and Hudson/Jenkins offerings which I
kinda didn't like both ;)

Cheers!
F
