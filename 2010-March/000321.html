<PRE>Dear all,

Source Navigator NG4.2 has been released. It is the continuation of
the very stable NG4 series, and also fixes two very annoying bugs:

- sometimes SN could go in kind of a catatonic state and no longer
allowed to save any files, among other problems (unsynced editor views
for the same file).
This bug dates back to at least the SN 5.x series and has caused a lot
of grief over the years. Thanks to Ray Minnerly for the fix!

- under rare circumstances (e.g. when opening a standard include file
via the include browser) SN could display a typical tcl trace; also
the file opening was not very platform independant.
This was entirely my fault due to a programming error - now it's all
fine again, and we use tcl's &quot;file join&quot; for that.


SVN people can switch to (or checkout) the following URL:
<A HREF="https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/sourcenav/tags/SN-NG4.2">https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/sourcenav/tags/SN-NG4.2</A>

Tarballs (and binary builds may follow in the next couple of days) here:
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8334">http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8334</A>

We're still looking for help - and I'm desperately looking for a win32
guy who can help me build and test under win32. Mark also reported a
few problems under win7, so if you can help out there please drop a
mail.

Cheers,
Freek

</PRE>
